Fade2D, v2.04, February 22nd. 2023
==================================

Welcome to the Fade2D Library! Two important things first:

1. UPGRADES FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION:

When you upgrade, do *also* replace the header files.

2. COMPILING ON LINUX/MAC:

+ Edit the Makefile and uncomment (only!) the line with your OS. 
Make sure you have libgmp installed.





Getting started
===============

Find instructions for compiling in the very first example online
or simply look below:


* Visual Studio:
----------------
Open a solution file 

  examples_2D/vs20xx_exampleProject/examples_2D.sln   
  examples_25D/vs20xx_exampleProject/examples_25D.sln   

For maximum performance compile in x64 Release mode. Find the executable 
in fadeRelease/x64 and run it in a command line window (cmd.exe). When
you link the library with your own software you can use the same settings
that you find in the example solutions. 

VS2010 - version 10 - toolset v100 or Windows7.1SDK
VS2012 - version 11 - toolset v110 
VS2013 - version 12 - toolset v120
VS2015 - version 14 - toolset v140
VS2017 - version 15 - toolset v141
VS2019 - version 16 - toolset v142
VS2022 - version 17 - toolset v143

* Linux and Mac: 
----------------
cd examples_2D   (or examples_25D)

* In the Makefile, choose your Linux distribution or Apple (if a specific 
Linux distro is not listed use a similar one). Be sure libgmp is installed.

$> make
$> ./examples_2D   (or ./examples_25D)





Documentation
=============

This software package contains C++ example source codes that cover 
the different topics. They are documented here:

  https://www.geom.at/category/fade2d-examples/
  https://www.geom.at/category/fade25d-examples/

Library Documentation can be found here:

  https://www.geom.at/fade2d/html

Supported platforms:
 
- Windows (VS2010, VS2012, VS2013, VS2015, VS2017, VS2019, VS2022) 
- Linux (gcc) for x86_64 and Raspberry PI (ARMv6, ARMv7)
- Mac (clang)
- iOS (new since Fade v1.96, please report any issues!)




Directories
===========

* include_fade2d and include_fade25d
Header files of Fade2D and Fade25D

* x64 (Win32)
The *.dll and *.lib files. This is also the output directory for the
example executables compiled with Visual Studio.

* lib_${DISTRO}_${ARCHITECTURE}
The shared libraries (*.so) for Linux and (*.dylib) Apple developers. The 
libraries work for a wide range of Linux distributions. Commercial users 
who need support for a certain additional Linux distribution: Please get 
in contact with the author. 

* examples_2D
Source code of all examples using Fade2D

* examples_25D
Source code of all examples using Fade2.5D

* doc

Licensing
=========


Student license
---------------

Fade is not free software. But the student license is free of charge 
for personal non-commercial scientific research and it can be used 
without registration. When you use Fade in your software,

+ Please put a LINK TO FADE on your research page or your project homepage.
+ Describe and cite Fade in scientific publications for which you have used it.
+ Make clear that the software may not be used commercially.

Limits of the student version:
------------------------------
2D triangulation:   1 million points
2.5D triangulation: 100 000 points
Voronoi diagram:    100 000 points
Meshing:            50 000 output triangles
Cut&Fill:           10 000 triangles
SegmentChecker:     50 000 segments

Not enough for evaluation purposes? Ask the author (bkorn@geom.at) for an 
extended evaluation license if your project requires larger limits. Please 
describe your project and include a link to your research homepage. 


Commercial license
------------------

All other applications, including commercial in-house usage, require a 
commercial license which has the advantage of maintenance, error corrections 
and personal support. The commercial license of Fade consists of several parts:

+ The Fade2D base component (mandatory): It covers 2D Delaunay triangulations, 
constrained Delaunay triangulations (insertion of segments) and the SegmentChecker
+ The Quality Mesh Generator (optional): Delaunay Meshing and Grid Meshing refines 
meshes to achieve well shaped triangles. You might have a look at the examples.
+ The Fade2.5D extension (optional): This is for 2.5D point clouds i.e., for 
terrains and other height fields: Points have (x,y,z)-coordinates and there 
is a bunch of additional algorithms like ISO line computation, height queries, 
point cloud simplification, valley-ridge-optimization, 2.5D segment checking. 
Existing triangles can be imported and trimmed.
+ The Cut&Fill software for earthwork calculations (optional): Cut-And-Fill 
computes the volume between two overlapping TIN.

For a commercial license please contact the author (bkorn@geom.at). Please 
describe your software project briefly and tell us which fade components you 
would like to use.
