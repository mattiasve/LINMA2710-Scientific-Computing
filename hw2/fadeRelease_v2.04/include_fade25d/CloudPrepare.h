/** \brief CloudPrepare simplifies overdense point clouds and
 * helps to avoid memory-usage-peaks during data transfer.
 *
 * This class has two applications:
 * 1. <b>Simplification of over-dense point clouds</b> from areal and
 * photogrammetry surveys. The reduction is either grid-based or
 * z-adaptive with a tolerance threshold for the height error. Four
 * strategies can be selected for grouping similar points: MIN, MAX,
 * MEDIAN and AVG. MIN corresponds to simple ground filtering, since
 * it favors ground measurement points over those on vegetation.
 * MEDIAN stabilizes the point cloud because it removes outliers
 * while AVG is well suited to reduce noise in the scan.
 *
 * 2. <b>Avoding memory usage peaks</b> when triangulating a large
 * point cloud: Usually you have all vertices in the data structures
 * of your own software and when you then call Fade_2D::insert(),
 * triangles are created immediately and only after that you have
 * the possibility to remove the points from your own data structures.
 * This means for a short time the vertices are duplicated in memory,
 * and this creates an unnecessary memory peak. The solution is to
 * give the points to the CloudPrepare class in advance (one-by-one
 * or all at once) and to delete them from your own data structures
 * while not a single triangle exists yet. Only then call
 * Fade_2D::insert(&CloudPrepare).This avoids duplicating memory
 * usage for the vertices.
 *
 * Have a look at the <a href="https://www.geom.at/terrain-triangulation/">Examples</a>.
 *
 * @note This class replaces the EfficientModel class. It is much
 * more memory-efficient and it is extremely fast.
